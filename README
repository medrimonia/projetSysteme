If your application uses modules, it must be compiled and linked with the 
options returned by one of the following pkg-config invocations:

$ pkg-config --cflags --libs gmodule-no-export-2.0 
$ pkg-config --cflags --libs gmodule-2.0 

The difference between the two is that gmodule-2.0 adds --export-dynamic to the
linker flags, which is often not needed.

The simplest way to compile a program is to use the "backticks" feature of the 
shell. If you enclose a command in backticks (not single quotes), then its 
output will be substituted into the command line before execution. So to 
compile a GLib Hello, World, you would type the following:

$ cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` thread.c -Wall -Wextra -c
